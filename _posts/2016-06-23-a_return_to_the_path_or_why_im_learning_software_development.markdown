I have always been good with computers. Not in the tear-them-down-build-them-back-up kind of way, more in the I-just-kind-of-understand-how-it-works kind of way. In high school, my computer science class had 3 computers and 6 kids (welcome to the 80s!) and a teacher that barely knew how to turn the thing on.  Needless to say, my enthusiasm waned as it wasn't exactly fun, didn't feel creative and I certainly wasn't encouraged, so instead I studied art.  

Throughout my 20s, I temped across the country, from San Francisco to New York, and I was good. If I didn't know a program, I could learn it within an hour of sitting down. I was always in demand as I could easily step into almost any position. After several years, and several moves, I found myself with an entry-level position scanning storyboards at Sony Pictures. The monotony was there from the first day, and I knew that though I wanted to stay, I was way too smart to be a scanner for too much longer. We scanned storyboards for the Animatic Department which would then turn them into a rough cut to be sent to Korea to be animated. I was going to be an Animatic Editor. Within a few short months, I was an Editor. For the next 5 years, I ran the Animatic Department and was eventually poached to work on a Direct-to-Video in the faraway land of Canadia.  

The job was Senior Avid Editor and I had never worked on Avid. I learned fast and excelled at my job, but the hours were long and the questioning of my abilities was ever present. (Being an attractive girl in animation, or tech, especially in the 00s, was tough. "How did you get this job?", "Why aren't you married?", "Did you sleep with so-and-so to get this job?") They broke me. I was alone in another land, and they broke me. I began questioning myself. As I finished out the show, I was unhappy, overweight and was sure that it must have been a fluke that I had even been hired.

Throughout the next several years, I became a Holistic Health Coach, went to Culinary School, and ran several restaurants. With every step, there was something missing though I couldn't place it. Finally, in December I was reading an email about learning to code and it clicked. That was it. From there, I began my journey, but first, I had to realize why I had left technology and vow to never allow someone's opinion of me to overshadow who I am and what I know.

Some days it's easy. Some days it's so hard I feel the tears well up as I question what I am doing and if I'm smart enough, but those times pass and I keep working because this time, no one is taking this away from me.
