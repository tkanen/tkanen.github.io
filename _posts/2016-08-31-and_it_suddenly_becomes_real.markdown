Since starting the program several months ago, it has felt like the prospect of working in tech was way out there, like being a freshman and knowing that senior year would come, yet also knowing that the time and effort involved were substantial.

Initially, I was focused on finishing as quickly as possible, spending every waking moment in front of the computer, passing labs yet not thinking about the artistry of the code.  It didn't take long for me to realize that the sheer number of lessons, my comprehension of the labs and my all-around sanity were much more important than being the hare trying to win the race.  And so I became the tortoise; carefully mulling over labs, taking copious notes, striving to write clean, concise, beautiful code and not looking further than the next lesson.  This has been key to understanding as well as comprehension.

As I gradually introduce myself to the local tech community, I feel the training wheels coming off.  I have signed up for a conference regarding advancing women in tech and though I'm not done with school, I'm proud and ready to represent.  My trepidation is overshadowed by the anticipation of possibility.  Though the finish line is still a dot on the horizon, I can see it and all the amazingly wonderful gifts it has to offer.
