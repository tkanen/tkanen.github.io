The year began with transition; realization of a path untravelled, overgrown with resignation and regret. As with most change, and even at times with growth, there is a breaking down in order to rebuild anew. The breakdown came as a ravaging flu that cocooned me to bed, with a fever that burned through all uncertainty. The caterpillar must cocoon in order to gloriously butterfly. It was time to fly.

Transition begins with an impetus for change; a better job, a healthier body, a bettering of self and/or situation. It's rare to see one push beyond personal boundaries, take a chance and pursue a dream. Truly, it is the brave who seek out the unknown for the promise and possibility of greatness. The greatness of living life like you mean it; exploring, learning and growing beyond your present interior and exterior landscape.  

The map to personal greatness is twisting and jumbled and navigating by sight is nearly impossible. Sometimes there is no map at all, just a fleeting scent, a glimmer or possibly a strum on a heartstring that points the direction. Pay attention, learn to navigate by firefly and aspire to dare greatly.
